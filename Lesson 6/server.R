# A reactive expression is an R expression that uses widget input and 
# returns a value. The reactive expression will update this value whenever 
# the original widget changes.
  
# To create a reactive expression use the reactive function, which takes 
# an R expression surrounded by braces (just like the render* functions).

# Reactive expressions are a bit smarter than regular R functions. They 
# cache their values and know when their values have become outdated. What 
# does this mean? The first time that you run a reactive expression, the 
# expression will save its result in your computerâ€™s memory. The next time 
# you call the reactive expression, it can return this saved result without 
# doing any computation (which will make your app faster).
